# Paddy Disease Classification

The main objective of this challenge is to develop a deep learning based machine or model to accurately classify images of paddy leaves. We used a training dataset of 10,407 (75%) images labeled in ten classes (nine disease categories and one normal leaf). In addition, we were also provided with additional metadata for each image, such as paddy variety and age. Our task was to classify each rice image in the test dataset of 3,469 images (25%) into one of nine disease categories or one normal leaf.The dataset can be found here : https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/paddy-disease-classification/data.
